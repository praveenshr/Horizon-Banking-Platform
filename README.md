## ⚙️ Planned Optimizations
- **Improve Speed**: I would focus on making the app load faster by using **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for important pages. This would help pages load quicker and improve search engine rankings.
  
- **Optimize API Calls**: I would work on reducing the time it takes to get data from services like Plaid and Dwolla by adding a caching system. This would make the app feel faster and more responsive.

- **Real-Time Updates**: To make updates smoother when a user connects new bank accounts or makes a transaction, I would explore **WebSockets**. This would allow the app to instantly show new data without needing to reload the page.

- **Better User Interface**: I would add features like **dark mode** to make the app more customizable for users. I would also focus on improving accessibility, making sure the app works well for users with disabilities.

- **Optimize Data Handling**: For large amounts of transaction data, I would implement **pagination** to break the data into smaller chunks, making it easier to navigate.

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- **Security**: Handling sensitive financial data requires implementing secure API calls and strict data validation (e.g., OAuth with Plaid).
  
- **Complex Integrations**: Integrating multiple third-party services (Plaid, Dwolla) requires careful API management and adherence to rate limits.
  
- **Real-Time Functionality**: Managing real-time data across multiple users and banks required careful design of state management and WebSocket connections.
